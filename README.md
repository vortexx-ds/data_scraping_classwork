# IMDb Top 250 Movies Data Scraper

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how to scrape movie data from IMDb using Python. Specifically, the script targets the IMDb "[Top 250 Movies](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/)" page and extracts details such as the movie title, release year, and IMDb rating. The scraped data is saved into a CSV file for further analysis.

## How the Script Works
1. *Fetch the Web Page:*
   - The script sends a GET request to the IMDb Top 250 page using the requests library.
   - A User-Agent header is included to ensure the request is not blocked.

2. *Parse the Web Page:*
   - The BeautifulSoup library is used to parse the HTML content.
   - The script identifies the table containing the top movies using the table's unique attributes.

3. *Extract Data:*
   - The script loops through each row of the table (<tr> tags) to extract:
     - Movie title (from the "Title" column)
     - Release year (extracted from the title details)
     - IMDb rating (from the "Rating" column)

4. *Save Data:*
   - The extracted data is stored in a structured format using the pandas library and exported to a CSV file.
